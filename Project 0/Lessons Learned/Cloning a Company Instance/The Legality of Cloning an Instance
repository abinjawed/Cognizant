It is not possible to clone company  instance to your private instance.

Reasons:
--> private instance is very small data storage size and it does not have capacity to store your company data in your private instance.

--> You cannot use personal developer instance for commercial purpose.

---> Due to security reasons, servicenow is not providing cloning options from your company instance to your personal instance.

Workaround:-
--> You may request permission to capture items in update sets and move them over.

--> You may request manually recreating the configurations (or moved scoped aps), unless you have all the update sets available.
If your company absolutely needs an additional cloned instance I would work with your sales rep to make that happen whether permanent
or temporarily.
